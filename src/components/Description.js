        Removed from saved items Without taking out loans, many of us would not
        be able to buy a home, a car or afford a higher education. The fact is,
        mortgages, auto loans and other types of loans can help us to advance
        and reach important goals in our lives.

        The cost of a loan depends on the type of loan, the lender, the market
        environment and your credit history and income. Borrowers with the best
        credit profile usually get the best interest rates. Before you shop for
        a loan, find out your credit score and look at your credit report to
        make sure it’s accurate. You can get your credit report and credit score
        for free on Bankrate.

        All loans are either secured or unsecured. A secured loan requires the
        borrower to put up an asset as collateral to secure the loan for the
        lender. An auto loan is an example of a secured loan. If you don’t make
        your car payments, the lender will repossess the car. An unsecured loan
        requires no collateral. Most personal loans are unsecured.

        While shopping for any loan, it’s a good idea to use a loan calculator.
        A calculator can help you narrow your search for a home or car by
        showing you how much you can afford to pay each month. It can help you
        compare loan costs and see how differences in interest rates can affect
        your payments, especially with mortgages.
      </p>
      <p>
        The right loan calculator will show you the total cost of a loan,
        expressed as the annual percentage rate, or APR. Loan calculators can
        answer a lot of questions and help you make good financial decisions.
